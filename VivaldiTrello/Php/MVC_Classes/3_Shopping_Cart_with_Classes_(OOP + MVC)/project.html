<!-- Create a class-based shopping cart system.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a Product class representing products in the store.
        Create a CartItem class that represents an item in the cart (with quantity and product properties).
        Create a CartModel class to manage CartItem objects (add/remove items, calculate total, etc.).

    Controller:
        Use a CartController class to handle actions like addProduct(), removeProduct(), and viewCart().

    View:
        Display the contents of the shopping cart, with options to add, remove, or update quantities.

Practice Focus:

    Work with classes to represent items in the cart and encapsulate cart logic in the CartModel class.
    Use the controller to manipulate these classes and pass the data to views. -->
