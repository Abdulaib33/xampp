<!-- Build a file upload system where users can upload files, and file information is handled by classes.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a FileUpload class to manage file uploads (filename, size, type), with methods like uploadFile() to process file uploads.
        The FileModel class will manage uploaded files.

    Controller:
        Use a FileController class to handle actions such as upload() and listFiles().

    View:
        Display a file upload form and show a list of uploaded files.

Practice Focus:

    Work with file objects (FileUpload) and manage the upload logic within the class.
    Ensure proper handling of file uploads through methods like uploadFile(). -->
