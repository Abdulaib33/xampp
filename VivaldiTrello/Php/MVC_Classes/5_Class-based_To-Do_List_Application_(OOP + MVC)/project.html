<!-- Create a to-do list system with tasks as objects.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a Task class with properties (description, isCompleted).
        The TaskModel class will manage Task objects, providing methods to add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove tasks.

    Controller:
        Use a TaskController class to handle actions such as adding tasks, marking them as complete, and listing tasks.

    View:
        Display the list of tasks, with buttons to mark tasks as complete or delete them.

Practice Focus:

    Practice object manipulation and use of class methods for managing tasks.
    Ensure proper encapsulation of task properties in the Task class. -->
