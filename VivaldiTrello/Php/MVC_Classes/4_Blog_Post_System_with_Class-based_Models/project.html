<!-- Build a blog system where posts are represented by classes.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a Post class with properties (title, content, author, date).
        The PostModel class will manage a list of Post objects and have methods like createPost() and getPosts().

    Controller:
        Use a PostController class to manage post-related actions (list, create, update, delete posts).

    View:
        Display a list of blog posts with options to add and edit posts.

Practice Focus:

    Practice working with multiple objects of the Post class in both the model and controller.
    Use class methods to manage data flow (e.g., adding posts, listing posts). -->
