<!-- Extend the blog system to allow users to add comments to blog posts.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a Comment class with properties (postId, author, commentText, date), and methods like addComment() and getCommentsByPostId().
        The PostModel will now also manage comments for each post.

    Controller:
        Use a CommentController class to handle adding and displaying comments.

    View:
        Display comments under each blog post, and create a form to add new comments.

Practice Focus:

    Practice working with a secondary object type (Comment) and ensure proper data flow between posts and comments.
    Ensure that the controller handles both adding and retrieving comments properly. -->
