<!-- Extend the basic product listing system from earlier, but use classes for the Product entity.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a Product class with properties (name, price, category), and methods like getName(), getPrice(), etc.
        The ProductModel class will now manage an array of Product objects.
    Controller:
        Use a class ProductController to manage actions like listing, adding, and removing products.
    View:
        Display the list of products and create a form to add products.

Practice Focus:

    Create and manipulate objects (i.e., instances of the Product class) in both the model and the controller.
    Ensure that product data is encapsulated and manipulated using class methods, not directly. -->
