<!-- Build a simple authentication system using classes to represent users.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a User class with properties (username, password), and methods like authenticate($password) to check if the entered password is correct.
        The UserModel class will manage multiple User objects.
    Controller:
        The AuthController class will handle user actions, such as login(), logout(), and register().
    View:
        Display a login form and an error message for failed logins.
        Show a registration form.

Practice Focus:

    Create user objects and manage authentication using class methods like authenticate() to encapsulate user logic.
    Practice storing user data securely in objects. -->
