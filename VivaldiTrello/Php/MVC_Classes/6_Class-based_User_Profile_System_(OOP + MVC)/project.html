<!-- Build a user profile system where users can view and update their profiles.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a User class with properties (username, email, bio), and methods like updateProfile() to change profile information.
        The UserModel class will manage User objects.

    Controller:
        Use a ProfileController class to handle actions such as viewProfile() and updateProfile().

    View:
        Display the user’s profile and create a form for updating the profile information.

Practice Focus:

    Work with User objects and ensure that profile updates are handled using class methods for encapsulation. -->
