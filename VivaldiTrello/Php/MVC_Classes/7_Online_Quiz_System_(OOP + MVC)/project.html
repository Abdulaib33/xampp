<!-- Create an online quiz system where questions and answers are handled by classes.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a Question class with properties (text, choices, correctAnswer), and methods like isCorrect($answer) to check the correctness of the answer.
        The QuizModel class will manage a list of Question objects.

    Controller:
        Use a QuizController class to handle quiz actions (display questions, check answers).

    View:
        Display each question with multiple-choice options, and show feedback on the correctness of the selected answer.

Practice Focus:

    Practice creating objects (Question) and managing their behavior through class methods (isCorrect()).
    Ensure that the controller handles the flow of questions and answers correctly. -->
