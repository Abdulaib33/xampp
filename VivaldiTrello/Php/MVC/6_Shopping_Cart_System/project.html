<!-- Create a shopping cart system where users can add and remove items from their cart and see the total price.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a CartModel to manage the cart (product_id, quantity).
        Methods: addToCart($product_id), removeFromCart($product_id), getCartItems(), getTotal().

    Controller:
        Implement actions like addToCart(), viewCart(), and removeFromCart().

    View:
        Show the list of products available to add to the cart.
        Display the contents of the shopping cart with the total price.

Hints:

    Focus on how the controller manages the cart state and sends it to the view.
    Add forms or buttons for adding/removing items from the cart. -->
