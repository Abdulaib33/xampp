<!-- Create a basic blog post system where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a PostModel to manage blog posts (title, content, author).
        Methods: createPost(), getPosts(), updatePost($id), deletePost($id).

    Controller:
        Implement actions like createPost(), listPosts(), viewPost($id), editPost($id), and deletePost($id).

    View:
        A page that lists all posts with titles and a brief description.
        Individual post view pages that display full content.
        Forms for creating and editing posts.

Hints:

    Ensure each blog post has a unique ID so the controller can fetch or modify individual posts.
    Use forms in the views to create and edit posts. -->
