<!-- Extend your book list project by adding pagination to your book list.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Modify your getBooks() method to return a subset of books based on the page number.

    Controller:
        Implement logic to calculate the page number and pass a limited number of books to the view.

    View:
        Add links or buttons for navigating between pages.
        Display only a limited number of books per page.

Hints:

    Focus on how the controller manages which data is sent to the view based on the page number.
    Add simple links for pagination (e.g., "Next" and "Previous"). -->
