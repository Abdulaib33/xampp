<!-- Create a to-do list app where you can add, mark as complete, and remove tasks.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a ToDoModel to manage tasks (task, is_complete).
        Methods: addTask(), removeTask(), getTasks(), and markAsComplete($taskId).

    Controller:
        Implement actions like addTask(), listTasks(), completeTask($id), and deleteTask($id).

    View:
        Show the list of tasks.
        Add a form to allow users to create new tasks.
        Show buttons to mark tasks as complete or delete them.

Hints:

    Focus on the data flow between the model and the view through the controller.
    Make sure completed tasks show a visual difference (e.g., a strikethrough). -->
