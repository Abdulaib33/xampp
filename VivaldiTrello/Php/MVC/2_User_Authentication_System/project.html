<!-- Build a simple login and registration system using MVC.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a UserModel that stores a list of users (username, password).
        Provide methods for registering and authenticating users (e.g., registerUser(), authenticateUser()).

    Controller:
        Handle the login and registration process with methods like register(), login(), logout().
        Use PHP sessions to keep track of logged-in users.

    View:
        Create a registration page and a login page with forms.
        After login, show a dashboard for logged-in users.
        Show error messages for incorrect login details.

Hints:

    You can simulate storing user data in an array for now (or use a simple text file).
    Focus on how the controller handles user data and decides which view to load based on login status. -->
