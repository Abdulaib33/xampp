<!-- Build a simple product management system where you can create, read, update, and delete products using the MVC structure.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Simulate a database with an array of products (name, price, category).
        Provide methods to create, get, update, and delete products.
    Controller:
        Implement actions for adding, displaying, updating, and deleting products.
    View:
        Display a list of products.
        Include a form to add new products and a button to delete or update products.

Hints:

    Try to implement actions like addProduct(), listProducts(), editProduct($id), and deleteProduct($id) in your controller.
    Use HTML forms in your views to allow users to add/edit products. -->
