<!-- Create a mini social media feed where users can post short status updates.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a PostModel to manage user posts (username, message, timestamp).
        Methods: addPost(), getPosts().

    Controller:
        Implement actions like addPost(), listPosts().

    View:
        Display a form where users can add a new post.
        Show the feed of posts, sorted by the timestamp, with the username and message.

Hints:

    Use an array to store posts for now.
    Focus on the controller handling the form submission and data passing to the view.
