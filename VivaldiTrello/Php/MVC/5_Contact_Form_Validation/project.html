<!-- Build a contact form system where users can submit their details and message, and the system validates the input.
Requirements:

    Model:
        Create a ContactModel to store submitted contact data (name, email, message).
        Methods: saveContact(), getContacts().

    Controller:
        Implement methods like submitContact() to handle form submissions.
        Add server-side validation for fields (e.g., email format, message length).

    View:
        Display a contact form with fields for name, email, and message.
        Show success or error messages based on validation.

Hints:

    Implement basic form validation in the controller and show error messages in the view if validation fails.
    Simulate saving data in an array for now. -->
