Exercise Description:

Create a user registration system where users can register and view their profile using class-based models and routing.
Requirements:

    Routing: Use routes.php to route actions like displaying the registration form (?action=register) and showing a user's profile (?action=profile&id=1).

    Model:
        A User class with properties like name, email, and password.
        The UserModel class will manage user data and have methods like registerUser() and getUserById($id).

    Controller:
        The UserController class will handle actions like register() (to show and process the registration form) and viewProfile() to display user profiles.

    View:
        user_form.php will display the registration form and handle form submissions.
        user_profile.php will show a userâ€™s profile based on their ID.

Practice Focus:

    Use class-based models to store and retrieve user data.
    Handle form submissions in the controller and route to different actions. -->
