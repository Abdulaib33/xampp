<!-- Exercise Description:

Create a simple blog system where you can list posts and view individual posts by their ID using basic routing logic.
Requirements:

    Routing: In routes.php, create a simple routing system to either show all posts or a single post based on a query parameter (e.g., ?action=list or ?action=view&id=1).

    Model:
        A Post class with properties like title, content, and author.
        The PostModel class will manage an array of Post objects and have methods like getPosts() and getPostById($id).

    Controller:
        The PostController class will handle actions like listPosts() and viewPost($id).

    View:
        post_list.php will display a list of posts.
        post_detail.php will display a single post's details based on its ID.

Practice Focus:

    Implement routing logic that directs the request to the correct controller method based on query parameters.
    Use class methods (getPostById()) to retrieve specific post data.
