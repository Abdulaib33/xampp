<!-- Exercise Description:

Create a basic e-commerce shopping cart system, where users can add products to the cart and view their cart items.
Requirements:

    Routing: Use routes.php to route actions like viewing a product (?action=viewProduct&id=1), adding to the cart (?action=addToCart&id=1), and viewing the cart (?action=viewCart).

    Model:
        A Product class with properties like name, price, and description.
        A Cart class that manages an array of products in the cart and has methods like addProduct() and getCartItems().

    Controller:
        The CartController class will handle actions like addProductToCart() and viewCart().

    View:
        cart_view.php will show the contents of the cart.
        product_view.php will display details of a single product.

Practice Focus:

    Use routing to navigate between product views and cart actions.
    Use class-based models to manage both products and the cart. -->
