<!-- Exercise Description:

Create a task management app where you can list tasks and view details of each task, using routing and classes.
Requirements:

    Routing: Use routes.php to route actions like listTasks() (?action=list) and viewTask($id) (?action=view&id=3).

    Model:
        A Task class with properties like description, dueDate, and isCompleted.
        The TaskModel class will manage task data, with methods like getTasks() and getTaskById($id).

    Controller:
        The TaskController class will handle actions like listTasks() and viewTask($id).

    View:
        task_list.php will display the list of tasks.
        task_detail.php will show details of a specific task based on its ID.

Practice Focus:

    Work with routing to direct different actions (list tasks, view a specific task).
    Practice manipulating task data using classes and retrieving the data using methods. -->
