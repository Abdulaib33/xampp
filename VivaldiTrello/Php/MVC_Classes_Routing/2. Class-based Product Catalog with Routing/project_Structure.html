<!-- Exercise Description:

Create a simple product catalog where you can list all products and view individual products by ID, practicing routing to different pages.
Requirements:

    Routing: In routes.php, create routing logic to either list all products (?action=list) or show details of a product by its ID (?action=view&id=2).

    Model:
        A Product class with properties like name, price, and description.
        The ProductModel class will manage an array of Product objects, with methods like getProducts() and getProductById($id).

    Controller:
        The ProductController class will handle actions like listProducts() and viewProduct($id).

    View:
        product_list.php will display a list of products with links to their details.
        product_detail.php will show details of a single product based on its ID.

Practice Focus:

    Practice routing based on actions and parameters, and how the controller handles those routes.
    Work with class-based models to manage product data and display details dynamically. -->
